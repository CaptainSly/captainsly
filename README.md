### Well Howdy Ding Dang DiddilyDoodily!ðŸ‘‹

I go by a few different names. Azraein. TheCaptainSly. And also Zach.
I'm a java programmer, who specializes in writing failed "game engines" and a few tech demos. 

I'm always working on something new and useless, but you can check out the few things I'm proud of down below. 

- [PaperFX](https://github.com/CaptainSly/PaperFX) - I'm working on a Textbased JavaFX Game Engine. It'll probably go badly. Check it out!
- [The Lion King Mod](https://github.com/CaptainSly/Lion-King-Mod) - I'm making a Minecraft mod based off of The Lion King Animated Films and Shows!

I've started dabling in [Love2d](https://www.love2d.org)! 
Here is a list of Love2d projects I've made so far:
- [LoveToastify](https://github.com/CaptainSly/LoveToastify) - Toast Notifications for Love2D
