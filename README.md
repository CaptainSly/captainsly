### Well Howdy Ding Dang DiddilyDoodily!ðŸ‘‹

I go by a few different names. Azraein. TheCaptainSly. And also Zach.
I'm a java programmer, who specializes in writing failed "game engines" and a few tech demos. 

I'm currently writing a TextBased Game Framework thing called [Paper](https://github.com/CaptainSly/Project-Paper). It's based of an online textbased game called [Syrnia](https://www.syrnia.com).
I'm also writing a program called [Eden](https://github.com/CaptainSly/Eden). It's a Call of Cthulhu prop and sorta playground for learning how to write a better JavaFX application.
