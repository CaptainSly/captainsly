### Well Howdy Ding Dang DiddilyDoodily!👋

I go by a few different names. Azraein. TheCaptainSly. And also Zach.
I'm mainly a java programmer, who writes game engines, games and other types of toy projects! 

I have a love for Junk-food, extreme metal, and tinkering with things.

I also know the following languages:
  - Lua (Partially, I don't code in it a lot, heavy reference needed for basic things, but once I get going, hoo boi)
  - C++ (Yeah... I can print hello world to the terminal. Still learning have no clue how to write it yet)


Java Projects:
